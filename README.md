The autors are able to infer cell-state dynamics through analysis of collections of single-cell methylomes using a specific assay and bioinformatic method. Studying the epigenomic cell-state dynamics in three in vitro models of cellular differentiation and pluripotency, they observed specific patterns of epigenome remodeling and cell-to-cell heterogeneity. They propose their methods can be used to study embryonic development, stem cell differentiation, and cancer, as well as generation of composite methylomes accounting for cell-to-cell heterogeneity in complex tissue samples.
